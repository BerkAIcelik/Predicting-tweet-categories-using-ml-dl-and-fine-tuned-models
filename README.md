# NLP-Predicting-tweet-categories-using-ml-dl-and-fine-tuned-models
Different vectorization methods (BoW, Word2Vec, TF-IDF) were used with ML algorithms (RF, ANN, XGBoost, LightGBM), a complex DL model, a custom-trained Word2Vec, fine-tuned BERT, and multilingual models to classify tweet categories and compare them with other models.
